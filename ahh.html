    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="consent"><p class="one"><font size="+.5"><br>What is <b>consent</b>?<br><br>
    </font>Consent is the <b>unambiguous verbal agreement</b> to participate in any sexual activity with other persons. Consent must be given freely, and once consent is given, it can be <b>taken away at any point</b>. To be more specific, consent applies to numerous aspects of physical intimacy:  kissing, touching, and intercourse, (as well as other displays of intimacy,) all require the approval of all participants; male, female, and non-binary alike.
    <br><br>
        In addition, it is important to highlight the <b>“freely given”</b> aspect of consent. If a person only agrees because they feel afraid or <b>pressured</b> into anything is not consent - they should never feel obligated to have sex or that they “owe” it to their partner. Legally, a person cannot give consent while <b>under the influence</b> of drugs or alcohol, and the best thing to do in these situations is to allow the intoxicated person to sleep it off instead of taking advantage of them in their vulnerable state.
<br><br>
   Please stay safe! If your partner responds negatively if you decline their sexual advancements, or if they ignore your signs of discontent, then <b>they do not respect your consent</b>. We recommend discussing your boundaries and if they continue to disrespect you, remove yourself from the situation and cut ties with this person. <b>Your safety is more important</b> than their necessity to own your body. <br><br> </p>

    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="campus_assault"><p class="two"><font size="+.5"><br>The lack of security and awareness surrounding <b>sexual assault on college campuses</b> only feeds into this toxic rape culture.</font><br><br>
      The United States Department of Justice reports that frighteningly,<b> 1 in 4 female undergraduates </b> will be victim to some form of <b>sexual assault</b> before she receives her diploma. While receiving education and learning how to empower and make a life for herself, 25% of women are forced into the submissive roles that plagued women centuries ago in this <b> apparently progressive nation and era </b>. Due to the egregious amount of non-consensual sex in college campuses, an increase in awareness and urgency is necessary to both help and limit the number of victims, as well as ensure that the offenders are served with <b>appropriate jail time</b>.
<br><br>
       RAINN highlights that while a quarter of women are sexually assaulted in college, <b>70% of these crimes remain unreported</b> and of the mere 30% that are reported to the authorities, only 25% of these result in arrest. What is even more chilling is that many of those punished for this heinous crime receive minimal jail time, such as Brock Turner, the unapologetic Stanford rapist who spent three months in jail due to not only the judge’s concern for the criminal’s swim career, but society’s overall acceptance of sexual assault and rapists and the common practice of <b>victim-shaming</b>.
      <br> <br>A history of <b>incompetency and neglect</b> on the part of the authorities creates a culture of<b> distrust of the judicial system</b>, which largely contributes to the number of unreported sexual assaults.
      In addition, many people, both men and women alike, claim that if a woman were to <b> dress promiscuously</b> or put herself in a vulnerable position (i.e. get drunk), then she deserves the assault. The truth of the matter is that <b>a woman’s body is entitled to no one but herself</b>, and those that practice this victim-blaming promote the notion that women must exercise extreme precautions and <b>limit their personal liberties</b> to prevent men from taking advantage of them.

    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="wage_gap"><p class="three"><font size="+.5"><br>Is the <b>Wage Gap</b> real?<br><br>
      While widely repudiated and deemed nonexistent by self-proclaiming “meninists” and “anti-feminists”, the wage gap continues to antagonize working women across the nation, ensuring that no matter their worth ethic and perseverance, they will still make <b>78 cents to the man’s dollar</b>. While several statistics <b> prove the existence of the wage gap</b>, ignorance continues to depreciate these hard facts. Many more conservative outlets claim that men and women make <b> different choices</b> that lead to the salary disparities; according to these sources, men generally choose more dangerous and more high-paying jobs that require<b> more commitment</b>, and that even within the same field,<b> men work harder </b>and choose more rigorous job specifications, and thus deserve a higher salary. While many people hold these “facts” to be indubitable, many reliable news sources highlight several disconcerting statistics that in short, display that even while <b>female college education outweighs that of males</b>, and though men and women hold <b>similar jobs</b>, men are paid more. Here are more specific statistics:

      <br><i>It is revolutionary for any trans person to choose to be seen and visible in a world that tells us we should not exist</i>  --Laverne Cox<br><br>

      While women already face several hardships due to societal biases against them, the <b>struggle for equality, safety, and basic human rights</b> is more treacherous for transgender women, or women who were assigned with the wrong gender at birth. The estimated <b>1.4 million</b> trans people in the U.S. are consistently ridiculed and bullied for their identity, and even those who claim to support the trans community have several biases and lack cognizance of the realities that trans people face.
          Specifically, <b>trans women</b> account for <b>72 percent of anti-LGBTQ homicide victims</b>. <br><br>Many feminists discount the struggles of trans women and <b>separate them from cisgender women</b> due to their “life of male privilege prior to transition”. However, while they did not receive the same sexist treatment as cis women until their transition, they <b>lack the privilege of universal acceptance</b> and respect of their gender. While trans women may not experience menstruation or the pain of childbirth, the<b> sexual harassment and violence</b> that cis women experience often only heightens for trans women.

    </font><br><br>While U.S. laws that specifically discriminated against people of color may have been abolished in the U.S., a culture of racism still remains that allows many individuals to continue to <b>attack people</b> (and more specifically, women) of color with <b>zero consequences</b>. Today, women of color account for <b> 18 percent </b> of the U.S. population, yet are a <b>largely unrepresented community</b> regarding discussion on key issues that this nation faces, such as reproductive health care, gender equality, and economic issues, all of which especially affect them, as they can largely influence their status as equal members of society. While women of color have indubitably made incredibly impressive strides in every field, particularly in entrepreneurship and technology, their <b>salary</b> and coworker respect still <b>pales in comparison to that of white women</b> (and, of course, men). 
      In addition, white men continue to have the majority of <b>leadership positions</b>, especially in politics (even while they prove to make questionable, uneducated, and discriminatory decisions for our nation). 
     
      Women of color make up <b>a third of all working women</b>, yet their number diminishes as you go further up the corporate ladder; 16.5 percent of S&P 500 workers are women of color, yet they only account for <b>0.4 percent of CEOs</b>, not a single one of whom is latina.
   <br><br>
      Unfortunately, a sizable portion of feminists, called <b>white feminists</b>, hold racial biases and marginalize women of color while claiming to fight for equality. When women of color aren't given a platform to discuss the <b>partnership between gender and racial injustice</b>, the privileged white women gain advantage and enlarge the racial gap in America. <b>Cultural appropriation</b> especially takes form in white feminism, and becomes <b>popularized</b> as many respected white female celebrities wear dreadlocks, afros, or <b>exotify other cultures</b> in any shape or form. Some common examples of white feminists include Amy Schumer, Lena Dunham, and Miley Cyrus. <br><br>

    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="abortion"><p class="six"><font size="+.5"><br>The controversy surrounding<b> abortion</b>
    </font><br><br>More than<b> 40% of women will terminate a pregnancy</b> during some point of their reproductive lives. While abortion has been legal in the U.S. since the 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade, it is commonly practiced even in places where abortion is illegal, and if the United States were to illegalize the practice, the extremely unsafe process of <b>illegal abortions</b> would explode. <b>13% of women worldwide die</b> from serious complications from illegal abortions. If abortion were to be illegal or less accessible in the U.S., this statistic would only grow. 
<br><br>However, despite this fact, a conspicuous number of U.S. citizens are pro-life, or believe in the illegalization of abortion due to its actions against the unborn child. According to them, “abortion is murder”. For abortion to be murder, however, a fetus would have to be a living human being; in reality, <b> a fetus cannot live without its mother</b>, and depends entirely on her resources. If a woman were to get an abortion, she would be practicing the right to <b>exercise control over her own body</b>. Just as a person can refuse to donate their organs even if it would save lives, a woman can refuse to have a child. In addition, many pro-lifers argue that if a woman makes the choice to have sex, then she must accept the consequences of such, (i.e. a baby). This argument heavily implies that<b> a woman’s role in society is to bear children</b>, which is suspiciously similar to sexist values seemingly eradicated decades ago. In addition,  many women are making the responsible choice by having an abortion; if their child were to have a miserable life, then sometimes an abortion is the right choice. Plus, due to elitist laws in the U.S., many women <b>do not have access to contraceptives</b>, and therefore <i>can’t</i> practice safe sex. Why should a man be able to have sex without fears of consequences (besides STIs, of course), while women are left with the responsibility of a child?
      <br><br>“Ok, if you don’t want to raise a child, there’s always adoption”. The argument that women should give their baby up for adoption instead of having an abortion is quite ignorant of <b>the costs of pregnancy</b> that greatly deter many women. During the long 9 months of pregnancy, women have to pay for medication, doctors appointments, and more depending on whether or not there are complications. <b>Complications with pregnancy are the sixth leading cause of death for women between the ages of 20 and 34</b>.  Even without complications, just giving birth in a hospital can cost anywhere between <b>$3,000 and $37,000</b>. Many women simply can’t afford this. Plus, the childcare system in America is highly flawed, and many children end up in the <b>foster care system</b>, cycling through numerous foster homes without the promise of finding a forever family. 
<br><br>In many cases, the same people that argue against abortion are the same that <b>shame and shun young women</b> for their pregnancies; the emotional repercussions to this are far more damaging to these women than the process of abortion is. In all simplicity, women have<b> rights to their own bodies</b>, and can choose what to do with them.

    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="domestic_violence"><p class="seven"><br><b>Domestic violence</b> toward women
    </font><br><br>While this website works primarily to highlight the struggles for women in America, it is important to emphasize that both men and women experience forms of domestic violence. <b>A third of women and a quarter of men experience violence or stalking</b> from an intimate partner in their lifetime. 11,766 American women were killed by current or ex-male partners from 2001 to 2012, which is nearly double the amount of American troops lost during war in the same timeframe. While troops are sent to war to defend our country, people (specifically women) shouldn’t have to <b> defend themselves in marriage</b>. 
While the inescapability of physical domestic violence is the most highlighted aspect of domestic abuse in the media, many people are also tormented by <b>financial and emotional abuse</b>. 
<br><br>
<b>38,028,000 women</b> have fallen victim to some form of domestic violence in their lifetimes. Female workers <b>lose 8 million days of work every year </b> due to abuse inflicted on them by current or former male partners. <18.5 million healthcare visits> occur due to intimate partner violence every year. Not only does domestic abuse affect a person’s physical health and emotional well-being, but it greatly <b>alters their future and ability to leave these abusive relationships</b>; if women are losing days of work and spending money on hospital bills due to this violence, they can <b>become more dependent on their abusive partner</b>, who could then use this dependence to their advantage.
<br><br>
  In a similarly chilling way, many offenders manipulate their intimate partner into staying in an abusive relationship. They can make the victim feel like they <i>own</i> them, by preventing them from seeing their friends, telling them what to do, and even <b>threatening to commit suicide</b> if their ‘partner’ were to break up with them.  Arguably, the most disturbing part of emotional abuse is that many people are <b>not aware of this abuse</b>; they may believe that it is their fault, or that their partner is just protective and this is a relatively normal relationship. It often takes <b>outside assistance</b> to end an abusive relationship, so if you know someone who may be victim to domestic violence, talk to them and seek additional support.

    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="working_women"><p class="eight"><font size="+.5"><b>Women in the workplace</b> have discernibly more hardships than their male colleagues. </h5>
    </font><br><br>
  Male privilege in the workplace begins even before the job even starts. Numerous studies have found that competent men are hired more often and are <b>rated higher than equally competent women</b>. Professors at Columbia, UChicago, and Northwestern found that<b> two thirds of managers will select male employees that are less proficient</b> at math problems over more skilled women.  
In addition, research laboratories at numerous major universities select <b>male lab managers more often</b>, and offer them higher pay, and better mentoring opportunities. The bias that men are better workers than women recurs in both male and female bosses; even <b>women are often more likely to hire men</b>. 
<br><br>
Within the workplace, women face additional struggles to prove themselves to their colleagues; while skilled male workers are often respected for such, hardworking, competent women are often seen as unfeminine, aggressive, and untrustworthy. Women are either seen as <b>bad at their job or unlikable</b>- its a lose-lose situation. 
Even in female-dominated fields, where it would seem that women would have an easier time in riding the ‘glass escalator’, <b>female bosses actually prefer white men</b> when considering promotions. Women simply have a much harder time in achieving success in the workplace. 

<br><br>
Another major issue that working women face is <b>workplace harassment</b>.  In a study conducted by the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) of 500 respondents and 92 companies, <b>54% of respondents have experienced sexual harassment</b> in the workplace, 72% of whom are women. Many of these women do not feel protected by the law, because acts of verbal abuse, lewd emails or comments, and touching <b>do not qualify as criminal acts</b>, giving the offenders free reign to harass their coworkers or employees. In addition, 67% of participants in AWARE’s study remain unaware of their companies’ policies regarding putting a stop to this harassment. Women will never be seen as equals unless they are known for their<b> hard work, rather than for their bodies</b>.
